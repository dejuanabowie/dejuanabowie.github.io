Career Path
The game I am creating is helps build personal, professional, and brand development. 
This game is designed to help youth identify their career paths before deciding to enter college. 
It will teach students basic life skills and how to do without a budget. 
By starting with a zero-dollar budget this shows that everyone is capable of success if you are willing to put in the work.
